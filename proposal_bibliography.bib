%They propose
a system in which one model (a reinforcement learner)
chooses actions to optimize cumulative discounted return.
They train another model to map a model’s state representation
onto verbal explanations of strategy. These explanations
are trained to maximize the likelihood of previously
observed ground truth explanations from human players,
and may not faithfully describe the agent’s decisions, however
plausible they appear.
%Further, the model they train is a black box, so how does that help?
